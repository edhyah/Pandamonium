About Pandamonium
Pandamonium is a simple game involving pandas and leaves. More specifically, the general goal of each mode (classic, arcade, multiplayer) is to control the panda’s movement and timing of each blow of air to move a leaf into a basket without the leaf touching the ground. It operates on the Python programming language through the Python module Pygame.

Running Pandamonium
To run Pandamonium, a user must go through two steps. The first step is to install Python. If this game is running on a Mac, Python is already installed. If not, install Python version 2.7 through http://www.python.org/downloads . The second step is to install Pygame. Pygame can be installed through the website http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml . After installation of both, run the game. This can be done by opening up IDLE (which comes with installing Python) and running the file game.py in the Pandamonium folder.
